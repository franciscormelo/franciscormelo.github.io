  I am an <mark>MSc finalist</mark> at <mak>[Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt)</mark>, currently working on my master thesis in robotics. 
  
  
  Since I was a kid, I have been passionate about technology and how people interact with it. I had a dream that one day I could create technology that would impact the lives of people. To fulfill my dream, when I was 18, I decided to move from São Miguel Island to the mainland to start studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico.
  
 
 
  In the first three years of my academic time (BSc), I interacted and learned the fundamentals of multiple areas : Computers, Energy, Telecommunications, Electronics, and Systems, Decision, and Control. 
  I became passionate about robots and how they interact with humans. During the last two years (MSc), I decided to specialize in the Systems, Decision, and Control area, where I also became very interested in machine learning, and image processing.
